# **Subscribe to my Ad-Block**

Subscribe | Purpose
------------ | -------------
[Ad-Block](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block.txt) | My main ad block. Use it to block mobile ads
[Ad-Block (Simplified)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block-Simplified.txt) | Simplified version of my Ad-Block. Suitable for ad-blocking at DNS-level. You can use this as additional DNS filter in AdGuard for Android.
[Ad-Block (HOSTS)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block-HOSTS.txt) | HOSTS `0.0.0.0` version. Based of my main Ad-Block.

# Usage
My main Ad-Block & Simplified version is suitable for [AdGuard for Android](https://anonym.to/?https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html).

Ad-Block HOSTS `0.0.0.0` version is suitable for [Blokada](https://anonym.to/?https://blokada.org/) and [perfonalDNSfilter](https://anonym.to/?https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/).

# Recommended
For more strong protection, I recommend to use **BlahDNS**.
Its fast, no logs, block ads server, mobile friendly, tracking protection, and much more.
Go here to add it into AdGuard: [BlahDNS](https://anonym.to/?https://blahdns.com/)

Select one server that nearest to your location.

I only add filter in the app that i have used. If you want to add your filter to my ad-block, feel free to pull request.
