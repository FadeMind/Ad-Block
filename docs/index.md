# Usage
My main Ad-Block & Simplified version is suitable for [AdGuard for Android](https://anonym.to/?https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html).

Ad-Block HOSTS `0.0.0.0` version is suitable for [Blokada](https://anonym.to/?https://blokada.org/) and [personalDNSfilter](https://anonym.to/?https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/).

# Attention
My main Ad-Block block `graph.facebook.com` , `graph.instagram.com` and another `Facebook` related ads server. Make sure you whitelist `Facebook` apps if you encounter any issue.

# Recommended
For more strong protection, I recommend to use **BlahDNS**.
Its fast, no logs, block ads server, mobile friendly, tracking protection, and much more.
Go here to add it into AdGuard: [BlahDNS](https://anonym.to/?https://blahdns.com/)

Select one server that nearest to your location.
