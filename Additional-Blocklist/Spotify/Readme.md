# Information
To my knowledge, blocking Spotify ads like pain in the a$$ because music server also used by ads server except you play it on web browser.

On web browser, you can block ads server using uBlock Origin or AdGuard Browser Extension because it can block ads more complex.

Phone ad-blocker like AdGuard usually block whole server address using VPN.

# Beware
Spotify will block your account if you are blocking ads. That's why adguard don't block it.
