# WhatZitTooya's Ad-Block
Filter to Block Mobile Ads. You still need 3rd party AdBlock filter list like AdGuard Base, AdGuard DNS filter, or others to make your AdBlocker stronger. 

**Subscribe | Purpose**
------------ | -------------
[Ad-Block](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block.txt) | My main ad block. Use it to block mobile ads
[Ad-Block (Simplified)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block-Simplified.txt) | Simplified version of my Ad-Block. Suitable for ad-blocking at DNS-level

Recommended to use both to improve your ad blocking experience.

Feel free to improve this filter. I'm new in filterlist of AdBlock. :)
