# WhatZitTooya's Ad-Block
Additional filter to block Mobile Ads, Logs & Tracking. You still need 3rd party Ad-Block filter list like AdGuard Base, AdGuard DNS filter, and others to make your Ad-Blocker stronger.

Also there is additional blocklist for Xiaomi, Huawei and Oppo mobile phones (maybe Realme too). My main Ad-Block block `graph.facebook.com` , `graph.instagram.com` and another `Facebook` related ads server. Make sure you whitelist `Facebook` app if you encounter any issue.

[Ad-Block](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block.txt) | My main ad block. Use it to block mobile ads. Written in Ad-Block syntax.
[Ad-Block (Simplified)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block-Simplified.txt) | Simplified version of my Ad-Block. Suitable for ad-blocking at DNS-level. You can use this as additional DNS filter in AdGuard for Android. Written also in Ad-Block syntax.
[Ad-Block (HOSTS)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/What-Zit-Tooya/Ad-Block/main/Ad-Block-HOSTS.txt) | HOSTS `0.0.0.0` version. Based of my main Ad-Block.

# Usage
My main Ad-Block & Simplified version is suitable for [AdGuard for Android](https://anonym.to/?https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html).

Ad-Block HOSTS `0.0.0.0` version is suitable for [Blokada](https://anonym.to/?https://blokada.org/) and [personalDNSfilter](https://anonym.to/?https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/).

Feel free to improve this filter. I'm new in filterlist of AdBlock. :)
